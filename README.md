# CorePortfolio
This repository will be the ASP.NET Core remake of my current portfolio site, which is done in dotNet Framework and deployed to windows hosting.

The purpose of this project will be to allow me to host my portfolio on a Linux VPS. I will then drop the windows hosting, as all the other languages I work with run fine with Linux hosting allowing me to mix PHP(Laravel), Python, and dotNet with the same hosting.
